# Emaily
Survey is based on nodeJS 8.12.0 and npm 6.6.0. This is a simple app that sends out a survey to a list of emails and the collects answers from them.

## Installation
```bash
$ node init
$ npm install --save express
$ npm install --save passport passport-google-oauth20
$ npm install --save nodemon
$ npm install --save mongoose
$ npm install --save cookie-session
```
nodemon is optional, which helps you to get around reruning the app whenever you change your code.

## Execution
```bash
$ node run dev
```
